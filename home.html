        <h3 id="headline">Story over the years from Alan Turing:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1912</strong> -Was born in Maida Vale, London</li>
          <li><strong>1922</strong> -Enter Hazelhurst High School, an independent school in Frant in Sussex (now East Oriental)</li>
          <li><strong>1926</strong> -He entered Sherborne boarding school in Dorset. His first day of school coincided with the general strike in England, but his determination to attend class was so great that he rode his bicycle alone, the more than 60 miles that separated Southampton from his school, spending the night in an inn</li>
          <li><strong>1931</strong> -Studied from 1931 to 1934 at King's College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics</li>
          <li><strong>1936</strong> -Studied mathematics and cryptology while also building three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University</li>
          <li><strong>1939</strong> -Helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis</li>
          <li><strong>1940</strong> -Was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies</li>
          <li><strong>1942</strong> -Traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington</li>
          <li><strong>1947</strong> -Lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine)</li>
          <li><strong>1948</strong> -Was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers</li>
          <li><strong>1950</strong> -The turing test was created in 1950. The turing test was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain</li>
          <li><strong>1952</strong> -Was caught in a relationship with an unemployed 19 year old man. He was convicted for indecency because homosexual acts were considered criminal offences in the United Kingdom at the time. This is what lead to his downhill spiral right before his suicide</li>
          <li><strong>1954</strong> -Committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him dead</li>
        </ul>
